`cargo-contract` is a CLI tool which helps you set up and manage
WebAssembly smart contracts written with pro!.
You can find it [here on GitHub](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract)
and here on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-contract).

The tool has a number of handy capabilities:

```
cargo-contract 0.8.0
Utilities to develop Wasm smart contracts.

USAGE:
    cargo contract <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    new                  Setup and create a new smart contract project
    build                Compiles the contract, generates metadata, bundles both together in a '.contract' file
    check                Check that the code builds as Wasm; does not output any build artifact to the top level `target/` directory
    test                 Test the smart contract off-chain
    deploy               Upload the smart contract code to the chain
    instantiate          Instantiate a deployed smart contract
    help                 Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

## Installation

You can install it this way:

```bash
cargo install cargo-contract --vers 0.8.0 --force --locked
```

Use the `--force` to ensure you are updated to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.

## Usage

In order to initialize a new pro! project you can use:

```bash
cargo contract new flipper
```

This will create a folder `flipper` in your work directory.
The folder contains a scaffold `Cargo.toml` and a `lib.rs`, which both contain the necessary building blocks for using pro!.

The `lib.rs` contains our hello world contract â€’ the `Flipper`, which we explain in the next section.

In order to build the contract just execute these commands in the `flipper` folder:
```bash
cargo contract build
```

As a result you'll get the file `target/flipper.contract`. It's a JSON which bundles the contract's
metadata and its Wasm blob. This file needs to be used when deploying the contract.
You additionally get the individual `target/flipper.wasm` and `target/metadata.json` in the folder as well.
