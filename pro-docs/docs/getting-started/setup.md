In case you are looking for a guided tutorial directed
towards beginners please check out our [Guided Tutorial](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/).

## Rust & Cargo

A prerequisite for compiling smart contracts is to have Rust and Cargo installed. Here's [an installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

## pro! CLI

The first tool we will be installing is [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract), a CLI tool for helping setting up and managing WebAssembly smart contracts written with pro!.

You can install the utility using Cargo with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-contract --vers 0.8.0 --force --locked
```

Use the `--force` to ensure you are updated to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.

You can then use `cargo contract --help` to start exploring the commands made available to you.

## Substrate Framework Prerequisites

With pro! you can write smart contracts for blockchains built on Substrate.

Follow the
[official installation steps](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/) from the
Substrate Developer Hub Knowledge Base to set up all Substrate prerequisites.

```bash
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
```

## Installing The Canvas Node

The [canvas-node](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-node#note) is a simple Substrate
blockchain which is configured to include the Substrate module for smart contract
functionality â€’ the `contracts` pallet (see [How it Works](/how-it-works) for more).

It's a comfortable option if you want to get a quickstart.

```bash
cargo install canvas-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-node.git --tag v0.1.3 --force --locked
```
