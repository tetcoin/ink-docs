## What is the Canvas Test Network?

It's a [a demonstration testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fcanvas-rpc.parity.io)
which we have running live.
The network is running our [canvas-node](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-node#note) project â€’ a
simple Substrate blockchain which is configured to include the `contracts` pallet (i.e. smart contract functionality).

You can request some tokens to play with from our
[Faucet](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#canvas_faucet:matrix.parity.io) and
deploy your contracts via the [Canvas UI](https://paritytech.github.io/canvas-ui/#/upload).
The Canvas UI can also be used to interact with your smart contract and execute calls.

You can also run the `canvas-node` locally on your machine, e.g. if you just want to experiment
locally without having to request tokens via our faucet.
In the Canvas UI you can select if you want to connect to your locally run node or to the live testnet.
[See here](/getting-started/running-substrate) for how to run a local canvas node.
